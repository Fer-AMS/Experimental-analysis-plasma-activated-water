# Experimental-analysis-plasma-activated-water
Scientific case study on plasma-activated water stability using experimental design and statistical analysis.
This repository presents a condensed scientific case study derived from my
Bachelor’s thesis in Engineering Physics.

The work focuses on experimental design, statistical modeling, and
decision-oriented interpretation applied to plasma-activated water (PAW).
